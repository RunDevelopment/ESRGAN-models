## Models

### 4x-Normal-RG0-BC1

```
Name: 4x-Normal-RG0-BC1
Model Architecture: ESRGAN
Scale: 4
Purpose: A 4x upscaler for BC1-compressed normal maps with a zeroed-out B channel.

Iteration: 100k
batch_size: 8
HR_size: 128
Epoch: 89
Dataset: Custom. See below.
Dataset_size: 577
Pretrained_Model_G: 4x-Normal-RG0-BC1-alpha-320k.pth
```

Description: A 4x upscaler for BC1-compressed normal maps with a zeroed-out B channel.
The output normals will also have a constant-zero B channel. Use external software or image editing plugins to properly normalize the generated normals and generate the Z component (if necessary). Do no rely on this network producing unit vectors.
The LR have been compressed with various BC1 compression settings (dithering, weighting) using Texconv version 2021.11.8.1. Since the contents of the B channel influence the R and G channels during compression, the LR were given a B channel that was either the Z component of the normal, a random constant color, or a random texture (usually the G channel of the associated albedo) before compression. The LR + B channel was then compressed and the resulting BC1-compressed DDS was converted back into a PNG and had its B channel zeroed out.

### 4x-Normal-RG0-BC7

```
Name: 4xNormal-RG0-BC7
Model Architecture: ESRGAN
Scale: 4
Purpose: A 4x upscaler for BC7-compressed normal maps with a zeroed-out B channel and no alpha.

Iteration: 100k
batch_size: 8
HR_size: 128
Epoch: 89
Dataset: Custom. See below.
Dataset_size: 577
Pretrained_Model_G: 4x-Normal-RG0-alpha-350k.pth
```

Description: A 4x upscaler for BC7-compressed normal maps with a zeroed-out B channel and no alpha.
The input is required to have no alpha and constant-zero blue channel. BC7-compressed images with an alpha channel should be handled by the BC1 model instead. This is because BC7 achieves very different quality for images with and without an alpha channel.
The output normals will also have a constant-zero B channel. Use external software or image editing plugins to properly normalize the generated normals and generate the Z component (if necessary). Do no rely on this network producing unit vectors.

### 4x-Normal-RG0

```
Name: 4x-Normal-RG0
Model Architecture: ESRGAN
Scale: 4
Purpose: A 4x upscaler for uncompressed normal maps with a zeroed-out B channel.

Iteration: 100k
batch_size: 8
HR_size: 128
Epoch: 89
Dataset: Custom. See below.
Dataset_size: 577
Pretrained_Model_G: 4x-Normal-RG0-alpha-350k.pth
```

Description: A 4x upscaler for uncompressed normal maps with a zeroed-out B channel.
The input is required to have no alpha and constant-zero blue channel. The model can handle some light compression artifacts but has trouble with quantization artifacts.
The output normals will also have a constant-zero B channel. Use external software or image editing plugins to properly normalize the generated normals and generate the Z component (if necessary). Do no rely on this network producing unit vectors.
The LR have been generated by simply downscaling the HR.
